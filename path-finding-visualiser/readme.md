# Path finding Visualiser

This is a very interesting project, which utilises Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 points on a 2d grid, by avoiding the obstacles.

### This project is coded in c++, with proper comments. It requires additional library called SFML(Simlpe and fast multimedia library) for Simulation.
